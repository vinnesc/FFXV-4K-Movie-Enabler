# FF XV 4K Movie Enabler  
This script enables 4K movies for any screen resolution. The additional 4K resource pack that comes free with the game adds 4K movies. The default movies are 1080p. For some reason, the game will try to play default movies on 1080p or 1440p monitors even if the user has the resource pack activated. FF XV 4K Movie Enabler will switch 4K files with the default ones. Therefore, the game will always play 4K movies.  

# Usage  
```
python 4k_movie_enabler.py "<ff_xv_root>"
```

Please make sure to add the game root path argument in quotes since the default game folder name contains spaces.  

# Updates
24/03/2020: The script has been tested on a 4K screen, it works as intended.
